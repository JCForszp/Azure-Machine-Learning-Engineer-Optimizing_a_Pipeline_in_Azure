# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary

The aim of this project is to apply two methods to determine the model with the best accuracy to predict whether a customer will or won't subscribe to a given bank service (classification).  
- The first method used is to fix the model, in our case a logistic regression, and let Azure HyperDrive determine the best parameters.
- The second method is to apply Azure AutoML to the same dataset and let it determine the model and parameters that give the best accuracy. 

The project uses a unique dataset made out of 32 950 observations - with some caveats: 
three features are highly correlated (emp.var.rate, euribor3m and nr.employed) and the outcomes are largely imbalanced 
(88.6% rejected the offer, 11.2% accepted it, leading to a null accuracy of almost 89% from the start). 
So, the gap between the accuracy of the first method (91.76%) with the second (91.68%) and the null accuracy (88.6%) is pretty close. 
[Analysis](bankmarketing.html). More work needs to be done on the dataset to provide more positive cases. 

Relying exclusively on the accuracy, the best performing model was the logistics regression, at the end. 

# Details of the setups of the 2 methods

## Method 1 - Logistics Regression (Scikit-learn Pipeline)
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## Method 2 - AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
